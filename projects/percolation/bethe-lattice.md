# Bethe Lattice

The Bethe lattice (or Cayley tree) is a fundamental structure in percolation theory that allows for exact analytical solutions.

## Structure

A Bethe lattice is an infinite connected cycle-free graph where:
- Each vertex has exactly z neighbors (coordination number z)
- No closed loops exist
- The structure is self-similar

## Percolation on Bethe Lattice

On a Bethe lattice with coordination number z, the percolation threshold for bond percolation is:

p_c = 1/(z-1)

This provides an exactly solvable model that offers insights into percolation behavior on more complex lattices.

## Advantages

- Exact solutions possible
- No finite-size effects in thermodynamic limit
- Provides upper bounds for regular lattices
