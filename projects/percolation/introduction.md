# Introduction to Percolation

This page provides an introduction to percolation theory and its fundamental concepts.

## What is Percolation?

Percolation theory examines how substances flow through disordered media. The classic example is water seeping through porous rock or coffee percolating through ground beans.

## Key Concepts

- **Percolation threshold**: The critical probability at which a system transitions from disconnected to connected
- **Clusters**: Groups of connected sites or bonds
- **Infinite cluster**: A cluster that spans the entire system

## Applications

Percolation theory has found applications in numerous fields, from understanding disease spread to modeling internet connectivity.
